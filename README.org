#+TITLE: Book exchange
/Set of services for exchanging books between users./

First of all, you need to build all Docker images.
You can use our script:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE sh
./build-images.sh
#+END_SOURCE

Then you can start them using Docker Compose:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE sh
docker-compose up
#+END_SOURCE

To remove containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up, call:
#+BEGIN_SOURCE sh
docker-compose down
#+END_SOURCE
